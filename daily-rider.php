		<p>Working with a local business it&rsquo;s important to understand their unique needs and goals. With The Daily Rider, we worked with the client to understand their business needs, goals and positioning in the marketplace. From there, I built a site that utilized best practices to meet these goals &mdash; so much so that it was a Webby Award Honoree in the &ldquo;Best Practices&rdquo; category! </p>
