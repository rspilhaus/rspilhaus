		<p>One of the challenges with large sites is always organization. With FCCPT, I built an elegant navigation solution and user experience that helped funnel the user to where they needed to be. Additionally, I was able to introduce small touches like subtle animations to give the site a polished and engaging feel while still maintaining the necessary professionalism.</p>
