		<p>Email development requires a very particular skill set. Since there are literally dozens of different email clients, devices, and operating systems that your email may be viewed on, it requires an obsessive level of attention to detail and an intimate knowledge of email coding best-practices. I pride myself on developing emails that don't just look great in one client, but look great in all email clients. Iâ€™ve also worked with many different email marketing solutions to build Emails that look great and are repeatable and editable by the client.</p>
